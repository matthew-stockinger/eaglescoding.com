                <i>"The Aeris 3A is a small and nimble one-seater plane, mostly used as a training craft for fixed-wing flight, and to annoy ground staff by 'buzzing' the space center facilities."</i>

            <p class="w3-large w3-padding w3-sans w3-twothird">
                The Aeris 3A is certainly a good trainer, thanks to its low stall speed and high manueverability. In addition, it also has a high cruise speed, and long range when on full tanks. However, due to its high-maneuverability profile, coupled with its large delta wings and light, five-ton weight, the Aeris 3A can enter a flat spin or retrograde deviation more easily than other aircraft. These uncontrolled motions require skill to recover from. Refraining from rudder hard-overs (full left or right rudder commands) and rolling and pitching sharply at high speeds can help avoid deviations. Another aircraft, the Ravenspear Mk1, shares this same disadvantage, although to a greater degree.
