        If you are ever wondering where to go, or what to get done, than Vex and Delvin are the people to go to. They handle all of the clients who want to utilize the Thieves Guild's services. You, of course, are free to do as you please, but doing a job for them once in a while may reduce the sarcasm level for the time being.

     Maven may be difficult to please, but if you are friends with her, you are friends with the world. For the very few that have made her happy, she is willing to go to great lengths to help you out. She is on a different level than the usual thief-probably because she never does the thieving herself. Her nobility will become very beneficial for you.
