    <p class="w3-large w3-padding"> Super Smash Bros. has 4 main games in the series to date. The first being just Super Smash Bros. released in 1999 on the nintendo 64. This started off the series but the next game made it big. Super Smash Bros Melee came out for the gamecube in 2001, and was a big hit. It added a lot to the game and was much faster gameplay. In my opinion Melee was the best game in thwe series. The next game to come out was in 2008 which was Super Smash Bros. Brawl. This game added a lot of new characters and stages,but it was trash. The gameplay was slower and it was just overall not as fun as the last two. The last Smash Bros Game to date was released on the 3DS and the Wii U. The 3DS version was released in 2013, and the Wii U version was released in 2014. These games were both good but the gameplay still was a little slow.</p>
