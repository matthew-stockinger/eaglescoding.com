        This beautiful glowing blue waters are caused by a natural chemical reation known as bioluminescence where mircroorganisms in the water are disturbed by oxygen. The result is a glittering and sparkling sea water, known as the sea of stars. As the waves crash on the beach, the water glows in the dark and acts like a mirror that raflects the sparkling stars above.
