          <p>My name is Amber Moon, if you couldn't tell by the website name already. I'm not just a photographer, I'm a singer, songwriter, and musician. You could say I'm a musical prodigy, but I'm far from it. Music is my passion and desire, but my second hobby is to take professional pictures. I always take pics when I'm bored, or if someone wants to have professional photos taken of them. I'm more of a photographer that takes pics of nature and the environment around me, but I do like to try new things like taking professional pictures of people. Here's a picture of one of my friends Kaliyah, and this was one of my first professional photos.</p>

        <div class="w3-center w3-padding-16">
        <img src="DSC02251.jpg" alt="Kaliyah" style="width:80%">
        </div>
        
        <div class="w3-panel w3-padding-16 w3-center">
          <p>I was very proud of this particular photo, because I realized that taking pictures professionally of people would probably work for me. Kaliyah personally commented on my photos and she mentioned that I should be a professional photographer when I grow up, and after she said that, it got me thinking. Shortly after that, a couple of people came up to me in the hall and wanted professional pictures of them. Later that day I asked Kaliyah if she told people about the pictures I took, she said she told at least 10 people of how good my photos were, and at that moment, I was very proud of myself. From that moment on...I knew that this might be my career choice when I grow up, and maybe get some money out of it.</p>

          <p>Here is another professional photo that I just recently took at a photo-shoot at Apollo. Joel needed a portfolio for Hollister, and he didn't know anyone that could take professional photos besides me, so we met up after school and used the photography set in the back of the school. He just started posing, and I just started taking pictures. In my opinion, they turned out really well, and in his case he really liked them too. So I hope to have more "customers" in the future, and hopefully I can stay loyal to my interest/hobby throughout my life.</p>
