            <h2>What is osu?</h2>
            
            <p class="w3-small">osu! is a rhythm game built for the pc, consisting of four modes with Standard being the most popular. Once released in 2007, it's been going strong for 10 years growing in every way from the community to many, many bug fixes. To say the least, i'm very happy to have seen all the progress and to, very minamalisticly, be apart of it.</p>
            
            <h2>Information On Yui Fujiwara</h2>
            
            <p class="w3-small">Wait, wait, wait. Who is Yui Fujiwara? Well, that's my name in osu! Originally ZeldaMastr109, but I wanted to change. The name derived from a anime/Japanese styled version of World of Warcraft that I attempted to play, but discontinued because bad computer. I've been playing for 4 years and still going. I play Standard mainly and the other three modes on the side almost equally now-a-days. Not only do I play, but I also make beatmaps for the game. I've been mapping for a year and a half now and steadily getting more and more into it. Mapping is truely something else and an art, like wow.</p>
