    Welcome to my website! I came up with this One man Buisness  about a summer or 2 ago. Kiss my Grass is a Lawn Care Service I started up North at my cabin. I go up to my cabin just about every weekend! It would be nice someday to have people work for me and to get a bigger amount of lawns cut through out my entire Campground. About 1,500 people have a place there, so I could for sure find more lawns to get.

<h2>
   
My Experience!
</h2>
<p2>    I've been taking care of my lawn at home for many years. Doing things such as, mowing the grass, weed whacking, watering the lawn, going through the lawn to check for weeds, which I use certain weed killer products for. And when I'm done, I use a blower to blow off our decks and driveway. I've been doing that for years, and two years ago I decided to start mowing lawns at my cabin. We go up there so often, it became a good way for me to make some money.
