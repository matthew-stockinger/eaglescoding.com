     <b>Practice Makes Perfect</b>
There is no magic to getting betterâ€”it takes time and repetitions. The "10,000-Hour Rule," made famous by Malcolm Gladwell in his book Outliers: The Secret to Success, states that it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice to master a skill. Genetics and complexity can accelerate or impair the process. For example, not everyone can dunk, but jumping rope doesn't take 10,000 hours to master.

2. <b>Quality Repetitions</b>
The quality of your work is more important than the quantity. This doesn't mean you should put in less time; it means you will benefit more from a few high-quality repetitions than from a lot of sloppy ones. High quality means you execute at game speed, focus on technique and maintain a high level of energy, instead of going through the motions or rushing to finish. For example, perform a shooting drill instead of shooting around. Low-quality reps can actually hurt your game by reinforcing poor form. They are simply a waste of time.
