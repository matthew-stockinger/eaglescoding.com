			<p class="red p1 space-bottom">Skillet is by far one of my favorite bands out there. Skillet is the band that really kick started rock n roll for me. Skillet is an American Christian rock band formed in Memphis, Tennessee in 1996. The current band members are husband John and wife Korey Cooper, Jen Ledger and Seth Morrison. The band has 10 albums, with two, Collide and Comatose, receiving Grammy nominations. Two of their albums, Comatose and Awake, are certified Platinum and Double Platinum respectively by the RIAA while Rise is certified Gold as of November 10, 2017. Here's a link to the video if it doesn't play: https://youtu.be/Qzw6A2WC5Qo

				Demon Hunter is an American Christian metal band from Seattle, Washington, started in 2000 by brothers Don Clark and Ryan Clark. Although the brothers created the band together, only Ryan remains, since Don left the band to take care of his family. As of early 2010, the band has sold over half a million albums. The band's style is known for combining nu metal sounds and qualities with ones heard in metalcore.
