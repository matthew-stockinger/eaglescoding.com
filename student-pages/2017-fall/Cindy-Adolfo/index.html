     <p style="text-align:center; color:"> I'm thankful for the two people who've been taking care of me up until now.</p>

    <img src="167.jpg" alt= "mom" style= "width:1080px;height:450px;">
        <p style="text-align:center;"> Everytime you nag me, I find it extremely annoying, but I know it's temporary. I know that you always mean  well for me. Even though you scold me and punish me every now and then. But that's what made me as I am today. Thank you Mom.</p>
    
        <h3> Dad</h3>

        <p style="text-align:center;"> I've failed on many different stuffs, but you've always been supportive of whatever I do. You always treat me like a winner. Thank you Dad.  </p>

 You guys have always been there for me. You try to teach me the right from wrong. You try to be patient with me. You try to lead me to the right path for a better future. I know that I don't always listen. I know that I am stubborn. I know that I get rebellious every now and then. But never forget that I will always love you both. I'll be gone for college soon. Don't worry, I'll be coming and visiting you guys to make some more happy memories together. </p>
    
    <p style="color:white; font-family:cursive; font-size: 300%;"> I Love You Mom And Dad!! <br> -Love, Cindy <3 </p>
