    <h1>Don't hate!
    Appreciate!!!
    </h1>

    <p>Life does not always allow do overs, so appreciate what you have right now because you don't always get a second chance. Everyone deserves a second chance but in reality life is not always so kind, and those who are not happy with their current situation may end up wishing they had it back eventually.

    When was the last time you paused right in the middle of something and thought – “Goodness Me! I am very fortunate. Life is beautiful!”
    Now you start wondering – “Did I say that? Was it last week? No, probably it was last month! Ah.. last year, ahhh… Frankly, I don’t remember!”
    Most of us would never appreciate our current lives. That’s because we are never happy with what we have.
    </p>
    <p>
    We are still in the Pursuit of Happiness! Materialistic Happiness!
    “I will be happy when I have my own house.”
    “I will be happy when I buy a nice car.”
    “I will be happy when I get my dream job.”
    and what not..! They are never ending!
    We fail to realize that we already have so much to be happy about!

    We are generally pretty good at marking the big moments in our own and others’ lives; birthdays, weddings, graduations, once-a-year family gettogethers. What would happen if we gave ourselves permission to celebrate the little things? like, When the sun finally appears after a week of grey skies, grab a friend or loved one and go for a walk to celebrate the good weather and regenerative effects of rain.
    Pamper yourself after getting through a daunting task, such as cleaning your room or writing a report, by doing something you enjoy.

    Appreciating the little things in life involves focusing our attention on what is pleasurable, nurturing, and sustaining in our lives and away from those events that are annoying, frustrating, or hurtful. It means practicing gratitude for those everyday things that are easy to take for granted or miss altogether. Adopting this outlook won’t stop negative events from occurring, but it may help prevent us from over-emphasising their importance in our lives.

    <p>Hopefully this short video will remind you the importance of appreciating what you have!!
