        <h1>Buggy Page Assignment</h1>
        
        <p>This page has several problems.  Can you fix them?  A great trick for debugging pages is to read them from the bottom line to the top line.  For some reason, this can help you to spot errors that you wouldn't see if you read the code from top to bottom.</p>
        
        <p>1. Download a copy of this file.
            
        2. Debug it. There are typing and syntax errors. There are also some things missing.
            
        3. Show me when you're done for your grade.</p>
