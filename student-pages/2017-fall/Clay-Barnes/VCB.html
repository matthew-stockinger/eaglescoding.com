        <h2>PC: Pros, Cons, Opinion</h2>
        
        <p>PC (Personal Computer) is a computer that can be created by an individual's preference including software, hardware, and design. PC’s are mostly known in the gaming community for its wide range of upgrades including graphics, speed and connection with the games that are played. A pro for PC is the variety of upgrades and accessible prices are creeper then Mac (Depending on what you upgrade). Cons for PC’s are mainly the wide risk of virus attacks that can be infamous from slower your computer to shutting down your system completely. In my opinion, as a PC owner (Incoming bias response), I like my games, so I want to stay attached to them as much as possible while I still own PC.</p>

        <h2>Mac: Pro, Cons, Opinion</h2>
        
        <p>Mac is a Apple product computer that is created towards the working field. Mac have one component to run them, Apple, and they consider very stable as a system. A pro for Mac computers is the stable system and the way the computer runs smooth as considered by most. A con for Mac is the lack of upgrades that can put on the computer since it has a system update programed by Apple. A common complaint that Apple gets is that Mac’s tend to struggle running games. Another con for Mac’s are the price ranges, making it difficult to afford. In my opinion, Mac’s are a good source to run working and education wise, but I like my games and sorry to say, but Mac fails to do that task. #PCMasterRace #NotBias</p>
