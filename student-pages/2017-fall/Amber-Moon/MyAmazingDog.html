            How she came in our lives was a miracle. On Febuary 16th, 2008, in Wait Park, I just got home from school and my mom and sister were in the living room of our house, and right when i hung up my backpack and coat, I noticed there was something walking on the side of the road. My eyes adjusted and I noticed it was a dog. It looked like she was cold, and hurt because I noticed she walked with a limp, so when she walked up to our front door, I called my mom and sister and they entered the kitchen and also saw a dog outside the window and was approaching the front door. When the dog approached our front door, me and my mom were contemplating on whether we should try to help her or should we let her keep walking, but it seemed like she really needed our help because she walked to our backyard and started scratching at the back door. Then thats when we decided to help her, when we let her in our breeze-way, she was limping and shaking and she looked so terrified. So we gave her a blanket, a bowl of water, and we noticed she had a gash in the back of her right leg, so we bandaged that up as well. It didn't seem like she had rabies or was mean, so I held her in the blanket and petted her. Meanwhile, my mom was calling the police to see if they knew if this was someone's dog that ran off. Apparently, when the police got to our house, they had never seen the dog in this county, but they still took her back to the humane society. The next day we went to see on how she was doing, and when I saw her in that cage, she was so calm and content just to be in a shelter. I also noticed almost all of the dogs in the area she was in were barking except her, she must have been scared, but it looked like she was so happy to see us, and I was glad I could see her as well. A couple weeks passed by, and she was recovering slowly, and we really wanted to get her as a companion for our home, but we didn't have the money, so one of my mom's friends helped us out and payed for her. Then the day finally came when we got our best friend. While we were driving back to our house, we debated on what her name should be, I don't exactly remember why we called her Penny, but it stuck, and we all really liked that name. And to this day, she has stayed as loyal and caring as she was the first day we got her.

            She is a beagle/harrier mix, and she has a coat of black, with some brown and white. She is very friendly with small dogs, but she is very protective when it comes to bigger dogs. She is super friendly, and will greet anyone that comes to the door by trying to jump on them. She only knows a few tricks: Sit, Stay, Lay Down, Shake Paw, Stand Up, and she will only play fetch if you throw her a fake bunny or bird, because she is bred to hunt down those types of animals.
