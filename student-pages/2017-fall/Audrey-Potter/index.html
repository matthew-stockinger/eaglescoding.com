        <h2>A Memory Of My Mom</h2>
        <p>
            One of my favorite Memories with my mom is when we ride in the car with one another. The reason why this is my favorite is because I can talk about anything with her. We just sit there and talk. She just listens to me ramble about random things and doesn't conplain about it. That's my favorite thing about her, she doesn't judge. I mean she has her own opinion and she'll say it but she respects mine at the same time. It's so relaxing to just sit there with her and talk, ya know. In those monments I forget about stress and I feel as light as a feather. That sounds weird but still I love our car rides with just on another. I could of talked for hours but every car ride comes to an end. Out of all my memories thoses car rides will always be my favorite. I don't know if it's the same for her but for my I wouldn't change them for anything.
