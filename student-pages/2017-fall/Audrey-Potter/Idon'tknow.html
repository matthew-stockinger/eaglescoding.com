    <h1><b>Why does it matter?</b></h1>
    <p>    Who care if you have a Apple or an Android?, Why is it a big <b><i>deal</i></b>?<br> It's not like people will not talk to you because of the type of phone you have. The phone (apple and android) was just invented so it would<br> be easier to communicate with other homo sapiens. It wasn't invented so people can judge you on what type of device you have or the social<br> status  you are in. What they should judge you by is your character and personality. Instead we judge on what there wearing or the type of merchandise they have.
