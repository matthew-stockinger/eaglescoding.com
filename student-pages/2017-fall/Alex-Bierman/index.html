    <h1>The Giver by,Lois Lowry</h1>
<p>The giver starts off in a community that appears to be a utopia. A perfect place that is  
self contained and isolated from Elsewhere, every other place in the world. No evidence 
of disease, hunger, poverty, war, or lasting pain exists in the community. Jonas' family, 
like all other families in the community, includes a caring mother and father and two 
children one male child and one female child. Jonas' mother has an important job with 
the Department of Justice, and his father has a job as a Nurturer, taking care of 
newborns. Jonas has one younger sister, Lily. His family seems ideal. Each morning, 
they discuss their dreams that they had the previous night; during the evening meal, 
they share feelings about the events of the day, comforting and supporting each other 
according to the rules of the community.
