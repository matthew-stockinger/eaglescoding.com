        <h1>Apple VS Androids</h1> 
        
        <p> 
            Even though I'm a full time Android user these days, I do recognize the areas where the iPhone got it right. First, Apple has a better record in updating their devices. This is especially true for older devices running iOS. With Android, if it's not a “Google blessed” Nexus...it better be a higher end carrier supported phone. Otherwise, you're going to find updates are either sparse or non-existent.

            Another area where the iPhone does well is apps availability. Expanding on that: iPhone apps almost always have a cleaner look to them. This isn't to say that Android apps are ugly, rather, they may not have an expected flow and consistency found with iOS. Two examples of exclusivity and great iOS-only layout would have to be Dark Sky (weather) and Facebook Paper.
