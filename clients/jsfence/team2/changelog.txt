**I think I did this, but I thought one of the vinyl-coated pics was good.
**Look ok to you?

2. I attached extra decorative metal pics to add to their sub category.
**done.

3. Jeff was hoping for a little bigger logo or maybe it can go on the green bar at the top so it pops out more or both? 
*What do you think of this?

4. This was one of the few that didn't include reviews. Possible to throw a square in the information page with just a couple reviews?
