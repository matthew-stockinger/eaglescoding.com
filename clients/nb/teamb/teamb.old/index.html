        I am a structural engineer, who specialises in assessing the damage after major disasters--especially earthquakes. My role is to give an engineering opinion of exactly what needs to be done to the building. 
        I have three main strengths strong technical expertise, rapid response, and background &amp; training in working in austere environments.

        I'm a structural-engineering consultant who specialise in responding to natural disasters. I evaluate buildings in various states of collapse. I'm prepared to quickly mobilise. I can provide guidance to shore, repair and restore buildings. I have a long history of work after catastrophic earthquakes and hurricanes. I have been retained by municipalities, adjusters and non-governmental organizations.
