Vision Statement:<br>

"TRANSFORMED LIVES THROUGH THE LOVE OF JESUS CHRIST"<br>

We see SonRise Lutheran Church intensely focused on Christ’s love. We see SonRise moving into the world with the focus that only the Gospel can provide. It is a safe place focused on touching the lives of the people around us in as many ways as possible. It will be an active member in the community around it and will be a place of refuge for those that are hurting or broken. We will not just talk about the love and compassion of Christ but demonstrate it.<br>

The SonRise that we see is a Church committed to raising, training and empowering each new generation of leaders so that they might carry on and share the gospel with a new generation of people in the world. <br>

We see a Church whose passionate praise and worship is a true reflection of our love for Christ and his love for us.  A Church where people are empowered, challenged, touched, delivered and forever redeemed through their encounter God’s Holy presence.<br>

SonRise is a church where Christ is the center, and all action flows directly from His mission for us in Matthew 28(Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.) One that will continually look forward and see other churches springing from its midst. <br>
