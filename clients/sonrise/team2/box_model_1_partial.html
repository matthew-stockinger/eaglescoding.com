                Where the Sidewalk Ends<br>by Shel Silverstein
            </h1>
            <p>
                There is a place where the sidewalk ends<br>
                And before the street begins,<br>
                And there the grass grows soft and white,<br>
                And there the sun burns crimson bright,<br>
                And there the moon-bird rests from his flight<br>
                To cool in the peppermint wind.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black<br>
                And the dark street winds and bends.<br>
                Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow<br>
                We shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
                And watch where the chalk-white arrows go<br>
                To the place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,<br>
                And we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,<br>
                For the children, they mark, and the children, they know<br>
                The place where the sidewalk ends.<br>
            </p>
