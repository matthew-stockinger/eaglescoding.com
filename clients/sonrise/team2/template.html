    <p>One thing I plan to do over the break is spend time with friends and family. My family doesn't really celebrate Christmas, but there will be presents to be opened. I believe my mom is getting me a gift card which should be nice. I usually spend holidays with my friends because we don't celebrate them.  </p>
