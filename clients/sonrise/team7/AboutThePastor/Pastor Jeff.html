                I’m Pastor Jeff. I was called to serve the congregation of SonRise Lutheran Church by God and the members of SonRise in late 2012 after having had a 25 year career in sales and management in the printing industry in St. Cloud. While still in theological study, I served for the first two years as vicar and was then installed as Pastor since 2015. I feel blessed and honored to serve God and this community each day and take delight in everything this work entails.
I joined this new nearly-new church in Avon in 2006 after my wife Christine and I moved into this town with our two boys, two girls and two dogs. In these past ten years, the children have now grown and essentially moved on to schools and careers, but the little dogs are still with us. Christine is a kindergarten teacher in the Albany School District and we share wonderful stories of the great things that these kids are doing in school and the wonderful families that make up our community. This area around Avon is special and we love it here. 
There is so much to be excited about and, as the psalmist said, “I take delight in the Lord.” Whether in a friendly worship service, bible study or at community service project, there is much good news to discuss, especially the gospel message of Jesus Christ. I look forward to spending time getting to know you and invite you to reach out to me. I’m always looking for another chance to smile and talk about the things that are important in your life.<br><br>
