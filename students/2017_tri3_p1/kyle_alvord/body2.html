    I come to my cabin with my parents. We try to make it up as many weekends as possible. The big weekends such as 4th of july, Labor day weekend, and many others. My contact info is on the home page, that will be a way for you to get ahold of me, and I can let you know also when I will next be up.

<h2>
   
What part of the Weekend am I Available?
</h2>
<p2>  When I know I have lawns to cut on a weekend, I prefer to get them done early on a Saturday, depending on how many lawns I have to do for the weekend. Sometimes me and my parents will come up on a thursday night, therefore I can get my lawns cut on friday while nobody is there.
