  <h1>Amanda Medina</h1>
  <p>My favorite person in the world is Amanda Medina. She lives in Rosemead, California. She is a senior at Mark Keppel High School. Even though she's 1.8k miles away, she still manages to make my days everyday.</p>

  <h2>Some Stuff About This Summer</h2>
  <p>This past summer, I went to California to visit my family. My cousin, Alanah, decided to move to Minnesota, so Amanda stayed over at her house. I stayed at her house too, because I wanted to spend as much time as I could with my grandma. The first time we actually hung out, my brother came to visit me, and we went to watch a movie. So, the first movie we went to was 'Sausage Party'. It was really awkward. When we got home, we started playing a game called 'Spyfall'. After that, my brother and I went to the room to watch scary movies. And thorughout the movie, I was talking to my brother about her.</p>
  
  <p>For my birthday, on August 19, my aunt told me that she was taking me out to dinner. but she didn't tell me when. She told me to get in the car. So I got in the car, and she took me to Hooters. My whole family was there. I thought that it was just going to be my aunt, uncle, and me. My cousin brought her friends with her. And at first, I didn't Amanda there. So, I was kind of sad. But when we started to walk in, I saw her. And I wad really happy she came.</p>

  <p>So, even though Amanda is 1.8k miles away, she makes me so happy everyday. She finds a way to make my days. She is my favorite person in the world. I wouldn't want anyone else but her. </p>
